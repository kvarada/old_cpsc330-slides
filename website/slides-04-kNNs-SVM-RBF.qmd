## Announcements 

- hw2 was due yesterday.
- Homework 3 (hw3) has been released (Due: Oct 1st, 11:59pm)
  - You are welcome to broadly discuss it with your classmates but final answers and submissions must be your own.
  - You can work in pairs for this assignment. 
- If you were on the waitlist, you should now know your course enrollment status. Registration for tutorials is not mandatory; they are optional and will follow an office-hour format. You are free to attend any tutorial session of your choice.
- Ensure to complete the syllabus quiz. 
- The lecture notes within these notebooks align with the content presented in the videos. Even though we do not cover all the content from these notebooks during lectures, it’s your responsibility to go through them on your own.


## Recap

Which of the following scenarios do NOT necessarily imply overfitting? 

- (A) Training accuracy is 0.98 while validation accuracy is 0.60.
- (B) The model is too specific to the training data. 
- (C) The decision boundary of a classifier is wiggly and highly irregular.
- (D) Training and validation accuracies are both approximately 0.88. 

## Recap

Which of the following statements about overfitting is true? 

- (A) Overfitting is always beneficial for model performance on unseen data.
- (B) There is always going to be some overfitting in a given problem.
- (C) Overfitting ensures the model will perform well in real-world scenarios.
- (D) Overfitting occurs when the model learns the training data too closely, including its noise and outliers.   


## Recap

How might one address the issue of underfitting in a machine learning model. 

- (A) Introduce more noise to the training data. 
- (B) Remove features that might be relevant to the prediction. 
- (C) Increase the model's complexity, possibly by adding more parameter or features
- (D) Use a smaller dataset for training. 


## Recap 
- Why do we split the data?
- What are train/valid/test splits? 
- What are the benefits of cross-validation?
- What is overfitting?
- What’s the fundamental trade-off in supervised machine learning?
- What is the golden rule of machine learning?

**Select all of the following statements which are TRUE.**

- (A) Analogy-based models find examples from the test set that are most similar to the query example we are predicting.
- (B) Euclidean distance will always have a non-negative value.
- (C) With $k$-NN, setting the hyperparameter $k$ to larger values typically reduces training error. 
- (D) Similar to decision trees, $k$-NNs finds a small set of good features.
- (E) In $k$-NN, with $k > 1$, the classification of the closest neighbour to the test example always contributes the most to the prediction.

## iClicker 4.2

**Select all of the following statements which are TRUE.**

- (A) $k$-NN may perform poorly in high-dimensional space (say, *d* > 1000). 
- (B) In sklearn’s SVC classifier, large values of `gamma` tend to result in higher training score but probably lower validation score. 
- (C) If we increase both `gamma` and `C`, we can't be certain if the model becomes more complex or less complex.


## Intuition of `C` and `gamma` in SVM RBF
- `C` (Regularization): Controls the trade-off between perfect training accuracy and having a simpler decision boundary. 
    - High C: Strict, complex boundary (overfitting risk).
    - Low C: More errors allowed, smoother boundary (generalizes better).
- `Gamma` (Kernel Width): Controls the influence of individual data points.
	- High Gamma: Points have local impact, complex boundary.
	- Low Gamma: Points affect broader areas, smoother boundary.
- Key trade-off: Proper balance between `C` and `gamma` is crucial for avoiding overfitting or underfitting.
