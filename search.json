What would be the consequences?\nHow do we measure the success or failure of spam identification?\nIf you want to use this model in the wild, how do you know how reliable it is?\n\nWould it be useful to know how confident the model is about the predictions rather than just a yes or a no?\n\nIt’s great to think about these questions right now.
